        <h1>Minimoog</h1>
        <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimoog">Minimoog</a> was designed in response to the use of synthesizers in rock and pop music. Large modular synthesizers were expensive, cumbersome, and delicate, and not ideal for live performance; the Minimoog was designed to include the most important parts of amodular synthesizer in a compact package, without the need for patch cords. It later surpassed this original purpose, however, and became a distinctive and popular instrument in its own right. It remains in demand today, over four decades after its introduction, for its intuitive design and powerful bass and lead sounds.</p>

        <p>The Minimoog is monophonic (only one note can be played at a time) and its three-oscillator design gave it its famous fat sound. Four prototypes were made over the years before a final design was decided upon to release as a commercial product. The Minimoog Model D adapted some of the circuitry (such as the filter section) from earlier modular instruments, but designed other circuitry (such as the oscillators and contour generators) from scratch. To produce a sound, the musician would first choose a sound shape to be generated from the VCO(s) and/or the type of noise (white or pink). The VCO provides a choice of several switchable waveforms:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>triangle wave</li>
            <li>reverse sawtooth/ramp wave</li>
            <li>sawtooth/triangle</li><li>square wave</li>
            <li>two different width pulse waves</li>
        </ul>
